# Evaluation

* "What do you evaluate?". The introduction section of Chapter 5 has been 
  extended to better sell the way evaluations have been conducted and why they
  have been conducted that way. In particular, it is now much clearer that we 
  evaluate the _overal effectiveness of inductive synthesis_ through 
  controlled experiments. Links with thesis objectives in Introduction have been
  made explicit.
