# Evaluation

* What do you evaluate?

  * The introduction section of Chapter 5 has been extended to better sell the 
    way evaluations have been conducted and why they have been conducted that 
    way. In particular, it is now much clearer that we evaluate the _overal 
    effectiveness of inductive synthesis_ through controlled experiments. 
    Links with the thesis objectives in Introduction have been made explicit.
  * The conclusion/discussion section of the same chapter has been slighlty 
    extended and revisited to link technical evaluation results to the thesis
    objectives.

* Scalability (Charles Pecheur)

  * The scalability of the approach has been further discussed in the conclusion
    section of Chapter 5. In particular it is now explicitely showed that the 
    approach scales when one considers model adequacy/accuracy, induction time 
    and real time usage. 
  * It has been made explicit that the number of positive scenario questions 
    leads to _scalability_ problem when using the QSM approach on large systems.
    A solution to this problem is proposed, this problem is further examined in
    the thesis conclusion.
  * It should be noted that no new plot has been added that would show how the 
    approach scales (time or # of scenario questions) when the size of the 
    target system increases. The reason is that it would lead to plots whose 
    soundness is arguable because of comparisons based on unrelated sample 
    richnesses (a learning sample of 100% is richer for large target systems 
    than for small ones, in an unknown relation).

# Related Work

* Strenghts of our approach have been made clearer when compared to statechart 
  synthesis from Whittle and Schuman [WS00] as well as Kruger [Kr00] (Section 
  8.1.1)
* Strenghts of our approach have been made clearer when compared to the minimaly
  adequate teacher approach [MS01] (Section 8.1.2).
* A comparison has been added with Harel's Play in/play out approach [HM03] in
  Section 8.1.3. Strenghts and drawbacks of both approaches are discussed.

# Various other changes

* The_may_ vs _must_ of decision nodes in process models has been made explicit
  in Section 2.7.
* The advantages of introducing guarded LTS have been made more explicit in 
  Introduction and Summary sections of Chapter 3.
* References to OMT and Finkelstein's viewpoints have been added in the 
  introduction when talking about Multi-view modeling.
