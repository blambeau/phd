\chapter{A Multi-view Framework for System Modeling\label{chapter:framework}}

This chapter installs the necessary background about the formalisms we use and sets up our multi-view modeling framework. We've decided to present the technical background \emph{in situ}. Indeed, strictly speaking, the multi-view framework is a contribution of this thesis, but almost all its technical pieces, that is, formalisms, algorithms and techniques, are not. The chapter is organized as follows. The running example used throughout this thesis is quickly presented in the next section. Section~\ref{section:background-multi-agent-systems-and-behavior-modeling} then provides a general overview of the modeling framework, its main hypotheses, and how multiple models fit together. These models and their semantics is then detailed in subsequent sections. State machines are presented in Section~\ref{section:background-state-machines}. Scenarios and related constructs in Section~\ref{section:background-scenarios}. We then turn to state based abstractions by describing fluents and their use for capturing state invariants in Section~\ref{section:background-fluents}, and goals and domain properties in Section~\ref{section:background-goals}. We close this chapter in Section~\ref{section:background-discussion}, with an overview of model synthesis opportunities offered by the present framework.
