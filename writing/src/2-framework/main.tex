\chapter{A Multi-view Framework for System Modeling\label{chapter:framework}}

This chapter introduces the necessary background on modeling formalisms and techniques used in this thesis. It is organized as follows. The running examples used throughout the thesis are briefly presented in the next section. Section~\ref{section:background-multi-agent-systems-and-behavior-modeling} then provides a general overview of the modeling framework, its main hypotheses, and how multiple models fit together. The models and their semantics are then detailed in subsequent sections. Section~\ref{section:background-state-machines} introduces the class of state machines considered in this thesis. Scenarios and related constructs are defined in Section~\ref{section:background-scenarios}. To integrate event-based and state-based specifications, fluents are introduced in Section~\ref{section:background-fluents}. The fluent-based specification of goals and domain properties is discussed in Section~\ref{section:background-goals}. Section~\ref{section:background-process-models} introduces guarded process models.
