\section{Running example: a simple train control system\label{section:background-running-example}}

A simplified train control system will be used as running example for illustrating concepts and techniques throughout this thesis. The system is composed of a software train controller, actuators for doors and train acceleration, sensors and passengers. Through the actuators, the software controller controls operations like starting or stopping the train, opening or closing doors, and so on. A safety goal requires train doors to remain closed while the train is moving. If the train is not moving and the passenger presses the alarm button, the controller must open the doors immediately. If the train is moving and the passenger presses the alarm button, the controller must stop the train first and then open the doors. Typical agent interactions for the latter case are depicted in Fig.~\ref{image:train-scenario-all-agents}. The precise semantics of such scenario will be made clear in the following sections.
