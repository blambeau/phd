* 2.3.0 Introduction to State Machines

  * Is the concept of Terminating LTS really used ??
  
* 2.3.2 Systems as agent compositions

  * Add an image for composition
  
* 2.4.5 Flowcharting scenarios ...

  * Say briefly why not all hMSCs define regular languages.

* Section 2.5.3: a fluent might be TOP in a LTS state. I consider this
  as problematic (Christophe does not). The way fluents are used to prune 
  the induction process implicitly argue in favor of my position IMHO. If 
  a monitorable/controllable fluent is TOP in a LTS state, the machine 
  necessarily models classes of states, not agent states _per se_.

  -> Explicit consistency rule between agent state machines and agent states
     variables. 
  -> Why not numbering consistency rules??
