Building software-intensive systems is difficult. Most engineers and computer scientists agree with this observation, yet for various reasons. Among them, it has been argued that the hardest part is to decide precisely what to build~\cite{Brooks87}. This can be stated as the general objective of requirements engineering.

There are various ways of conducting software development and requirements engineering. Their relevance partly depends on the kind of software envisionned. Some of them will benefit from rapid prototyping and/or quick development cycles whereas others might require slower cycles and longer analysis, specification and/or design phases. Whatever the chosen path, one has to remember
