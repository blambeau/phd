\chapter{Related Work\label{chapter:related-work}}

This chapter discusses related work on model synthesis. We restrict our attention here to \emph{behavior} model synthesis specifically; we also briefly discuss a few goal inference techniques that nicely fit our formal framework. 

More specifically, Section~\ref{section:related-from-scenarios} discusses a few approaches aiming at deriving state machine models from scenarios. Section~\ref{section:related-for-analysis} discusses behavior model synthesis aimed at analyzing scenario specifications and process models. Section~\ref{section:related-for-requirements} then discusses a few approaches that use induction and model synthesis as a mean to infer requirements and explore system designs.

Model synthesis is a fairly broad topic. In particular, this chapter does not discuss model synthesis approaches aimed at controller synthesis~\cite{Clarke:1981, Pnueli:1989, Asarin:1995}, program synthesis \cite{Manna:1971, Balzer:1985, Wasowski:2003}, model-based code generation \cite{Kohler:2000, Wasowski:2003}, model-based reverse engineering \cite{Briand:2003, Yu:2005}.
