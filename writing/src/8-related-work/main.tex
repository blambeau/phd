\chapter{Related Work\label{chapter:related-work}}

This chapter reviews relevant work on behavior model synthesis and related techniques for model analysis and goal inference. We also briefly discuss a few goal inference techniques that nicely fit our formal framework. More specifically, Section~\ref{section:related-from-scenarios} reviews approaches aimed at synthesizing state machine models inductively from scenarios. Section~\ref{section:related-for-analysis} discusses related work on deriving behavior models for analysis of scenarios and process models. Section~\ref{section:related-for-requirements} then discusses a few approaches that use inductive synthesis as a means for inferring requirements and exploring system designs.

Model synthesis is a fairly broad topic. In particular, this chapter will not discuss approaches falling outside the scope of the thesis such as controller synthesis~\cite{Clarke:1981, Pnueli:1989, Asarin:1995}, program synthesis \cite{Manna:1971, Balzer:1985, Wasowski:2003}, model-based code generation \cite{Kohler:2000, Wasowski:2003}, and model-based reverse engineering \cite{Briand:2003, Yu:2005}.
