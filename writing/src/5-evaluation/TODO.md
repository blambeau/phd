# Section 5.1 - Objectives

  * What about Pierre's remark about Nb. queries and induction time? Other
    application domains such as reverse engineering.
  * Maybe show a typical accuracy curve after bullets on expected gains and 
    costs?

# Section 5.2.4 - Impact of goals

  * Show all requirements inferred

# Section 5.2.2 - RPNI vs. Blue-fringe order

  * See Algo 1 -> See Algo 4.1 (if possible)

# Section 5.3.1 - Evaluation protocol

  * Why not putting the definition of automaton *depth* in the background?

# Section 5.3.3 - ASM on synthetic

  * Update Fig. 5.5 (MSM -> ASM)
