\chapter{Derivation of State Machine Models from Process Models\label{chapter:deductive}}

This chapter shows how LTS state machines can be synthesized from g-hMSC process models. Section \ref{section:deductive-motivation} motivates such derivation and outlines the approach. Section \ref{section:deductive-glts} introduces guarded labeled transition systems (g-LTS) as an intermediate formalism between guarded hMSCs and LTS state machines. Algorithms for transforming process models into guarded and then guard-free transition systems are detailed in Section \ref{section:deductive-glts-to-lts}.

\section*{Summary}

This chapter has shown how state machines can be derived from process models captured in the g-hMSC language. The main objective of this transformation is to make such processes amenable to analysis such as model-checking. For this, a trace-based semantics for g-hMSC has been defined. This semantics is defined in terms of labeled transition systems. A guarded flavor of LTS has been introduced as a powerful intermediate form in the transformation from guarded hMSC to pure LTS; g-LTS are a structured form of LTS avoiding state explosion; they enable a variety of symbolic analyses involving guards~\cite{Damas:2009, Damas:2011}. Synthesis algorithms from g-hMSC to g-LTS to LTS have been discussed.
