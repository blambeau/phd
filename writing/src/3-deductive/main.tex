\chapter{Derivation of State Machine Models from Process Models\label{chapter:deductive}}

This chapter shows how state machines can be synthesized from process models. Section \ref{section:deductive-motivation} motivates such rewriting and presents the approach. Section \ref{section:deductive-glts} introduces guarded labeled transition systems (g-LTS) as an intermediate formalism between guarded hMSCs and LTS state machines. Algorithms to rewrite process models as guarded and non-guarded transition systems are discussed in Section \ref{section:deductive-glts-to-lts}.
