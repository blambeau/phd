\chapter{Conclusion\label{chapter:conclusion}}

Models play a significant role for elaborating requirements and exploring designs of software systems. They help abstracting from multiple details in order to focus on key aspects of the target system. Complex systems should be captured through multiple models. Each of these focusses on particular facets of the system along its intentional, structural, operational and behavioral dimensions.

Building high-quality models for software systems is not an easy task. To play a significant role, models should adequately represent the essence of the target system; they should be complete enough to capture all its pertinent facets; they should be precise when taken in isolation; they should also be consistent with each other. 

This thesis investigated model synthesis as a promising approach for building high-quality models meeting those requirements. Our model synthesis techniques were articulated along two main dimensions:
\begin{description}
\item[Vertical synthesis] yields the operational semantics of high-level models by deriving lower-level ones. This kind of synthesis makes high-level models amenable to formal analysis.

Along this dimension, the thesis defined an operational semantics for guarded high-level Message Sequence Charts (g-hMSC), a process modeling language used for capturing critical processes involving decisions \cite{Damas:2011}. This semantics is defined through guarded labeled transition systems (g-LTS); synthesis algorithms were described to derive g-LTS from g-hMSC, and to derive pure event-based LTS from g-LTS. The intermediate g-LTS language proves convenient for avoiding state explosion and for enabling a variety of analyses at that level~\cite{Damas:2011} The implementation of a model-checker for g-hMSC was also described; it adapts a compositional LTS technique borrowed from \cite{Giannakopoulou:2003}.

\item[Horizontal synthesis] yields missing model fragments in multi-view models. It uses the rules of inter-model consistency to produce or complete model fragments from the other views.

Along this dimension, the thesis showed how grammar induction methods can be adapted to synthesize state machines from scenarios that illustrate examples and counterexamples of desired system behavior. Our technique interacts with an end-user who accepts or rejects additional scenarios generated by the synthesizer. Declarative properties such as goals were seen to be an effective way of constraining the induction process so as to avoid undesired system behaviors. The induction space may be pruned thanks to such knowledge, resulting in a faster process, a reduced number of user interactions and a guaranteed consistency of the synthesized state machines with respect to such knowledge.
\end{description}

The model synthesis techniques proposed in the thesis aim at supporting the incremental building of system models and thereby the exploration of requirements and system designs. This objective is met in different but complementary ways.
\begin{itemize}

\item Vertical synthesis enables model analysis which in turn proves very effective for systematic model building.

The operational semantics of g-hMSCs paves the way for systematic construction through model analysis. The thesis proposed a model-checking procedure for process models. In addition, it enables a variety of analyses detailed in~\cite{Damas:2011}.

The potential benefits of such model building approach is illustrated with the Gisele process model analyzer described in Section~\ref{section:tool-clinical-pathway-analyzer}. This tool has been successfully used for modeling real, safety-critical care processes.

\item Horizontal synthesis achieves similar objectives but in a constructive way.

Our inductive synthesis technique provides flexible and effective support for behavior model building. It requires only a few scenarios in the first place but also supports structured forms of scenarios in input. In addition to synthesizing state machines that are consistent with the input scenarios, the technique calls for the identification of state variables and goals. It allows the initial scenario specification to be iteratively completed with new examples and counterexamples of system behavior.

Our approach is supported by the ISIS tool, described in Section~\ref{section:tool-support-isis}. Its effectiveness has been assessed through various evaluations, both on case studies and on synthetic datasets (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:evaluation}).

\end{itemize}

As illustrated in the thesis, our specific analysis and synthesis techniques already prove effective for model building when taken in isolation. However, their strengths appear even more clearly when they are combined in an integrated environment. This has been observed when using the ISIS tool on case studies. In addition to inductively synthesizing state machines from scenarios, the tool may infer goals from scenarios, decorate synthesized state machines with state invariants, and perform various consistency checks. A similar effect has been observed in the Gisele toolset which integrates a variety of analyses on process models -- see~\cite{Damas:2011} for a convincing case.
