\section{LTS synthesis from hMSCs\label{section:inductive-from-hMSC}}

The previous sections have shown how system behaviors specified in collections of MSC scenarios can be first generalized as a System LTS, then decomposed as a set of agent LTSs. The technique supports the incremental enrichment of an initial scenario collection through scenario queries. It also takes other models into account, such as goals, so as to preserve multi-view consistency. Behavior generalization, incremental synthesis and mutli-view consistency are the three main requirements identified in Section \ref{subsection:inductive-synthesis-requirements}. 

Coupled with other synthesis techniques such as goal mining from scenarios\footnote{whose simplest form consists in asking ``why'' when facing with a negative scenario.} \cite{Damas:2006}, interactive LTS induction is really effective; starting from a small initial scenario collection, richer system models can be synthesized in only a few iterations. Chapters~\ref{chapter:evaluation} and \ref{chapter:tool-support} illustrate this claim with evaluations and overview of the tool support.

However, for any non-toy system, a large scenario collection might become unmanageable. Among others, consistency of the collection might be difficult to guarantee without costly refactoring on scenarios. One reason is that all scenarios of a collection are required to start in the same system state; this usually implies a lot of redundancy in system descriptions.

One way to tackle this problem is to use high-level message sequence charts (hMSCs) for structuring scenario descriptions. As detailed in Section \ref{subsection:background-hmsc}, hMSCs are directed graphs where each node refers to a MSC or a finer grained hMSC (see Fig.~\ref{image:train-hmsc}). Scenarios can then be structured by introducing alternatives, sequences and loops.

Having a structured form of scenario \emph{helps} specifying a large system with scenarios; it does not \emph{solves} the problem of achieving a complete and consistent view of agent behaviors:
\begin{itemize}
\item capturing all possible interleavings of a distributed system renders difficult with scenarios; a hMSC is therefore hardly complete in practice,
\item complementary features of a system deserve being specified in complementary models; in addition to using multiple system views, having system behaviors specified in more than one hMSC makes sense.
\end{itemize}

Having a synthesis technique to merge and generalize behaviors described in hMSCs seems a convenient extension to the synthesis technique described so far. For this, the LTS synthesis statement is first revisited in Section~\ref{subsection:hmsc-induction-problem-revisited}. The inductive algorithm is then adapted in Section \ref{subsection:hmsc-induction-algo-adaptation}.

\subsection{Revisiting the LTS synthesis statement\label{subsection:hmsc-induction-problem-revisited}}

Merging multiple hMSCs $H_1,\ldots,H_n$ with respect to trace behaviors simply amounts to compute the union of their respective languages. Under both hMSC semantics considered in Section \ref{subsection:background-hmsc}\footnote{for recall, only weak (resp. strong) sequential composition of bMSCs with partial (resp. total) event ordering are considered.}, this is equivalent to building a new hMSC reaching the finer-grained $H_1,\ldots,H_n$ from its initial state. Additional positive scenarios, typically coming from scenario queries, could be integrated in a similar way.

TODO: an illustration is probably worth considering here?

However, a hMSC only permits specifying positive behaviors. As explained in previous sections, negative information is needed to avoid poor generalization. Negative scenarios, fluents, goals, etc. all provide a source of negative knowledge that can be used to contraint the induction process. The algorithmic adaptations considered later stay compatible with the constraint mechanism based on equivalence relations on system states.

Without much loss of generality therefore, we will assume that behaviors are specified through one hMSC only, complemented with a scenario collection. The latter contains negative scenarios and answers to scenario queries. Under these assumptions, the LTS synthesis statement is restated as follows: 

\begin{quote}
\underline{Given}~a hMSC $H$ and a scenario collection $Sc = (S^+,S^-)$ consistent with each other
\begin{align*}
[\mathcal{L}^+(Sc) \cup \mathcal{L}(H)] \cap \mathcal{L}^-(Sc) &= \emptyset
\end{align*}
\underline{Synthesize}~the system as a composition of agent LTSs
\begin{align*}
System = (Ag_1 \parallel \ldots \parallel Ag_n)
\end{align*}
\underline{Such that}~$H$, $Sc$ and $System$ are consistent.
\end{quote}

The hMSC trace semantics is left open in the formulation above. In other words, one has to decide which set of behaviors does $\mathcal{L}(H)$ denote.
