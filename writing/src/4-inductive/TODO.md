* 4.1.3 -- Rationale behind the generalization step -> Discussion
* 4.1.3 -- A word about correctness -> Discussion
* 4.2.4 -- Is is possible to reverse the presentation: intuition -> math???
* 4.3   -- Give an explicit specification to QSM (see Axel's comments on page 71)
* 4.3   -- Note on terminology -> Discussion
* 4.3   -- Algorithm 1 -> Algorithm 4.1 (if possible)
           Resurect Pierre's remark on our strange use of affectation
           RPNI is a special case -> after explanation, but where ???
* 4.3.1 -- Make event labels in Image 4.4 bigger.
* 4.3.2 -- Rephrase explanation of GenerateQuery so as to address Axel's comments
           (page 76)
* 4.4.1 -- Remark about equivalence relations being invariant under state merging
           -> Discussion
* 4.5   -- The constraint that all scenarios start in the same system state must
           be stated before!!!! (see Axel's comments on page 87)
* 4.5.1 -- The fact that the constraint mechanism remains compatible must be 
           discussed once again later (see Axel's comments on page 88)
* 4.5.2 -- Relation (4.9) should probably appear at beginning of the chapter
* 4.5.3 -- Give an example of ASM in action
