\chapter{Inductive Synthesis of State Machines from Scenarios\label{chapter:inductive-synthesis}}

This chapter presents an inductive technique for synthesizing state machines from scenarios. Section~\ref{section:inductive-objectives-and-approach} characterizes the problem, discusses a few requirements and provides an overview of our solution. Section~\ref{section:inductive-background} provides background on grammar induction, the inductive framework on which techniques of the chapter are built \cite{Gold:1978}. Section~\ref{section:lts-induction-from-mscs} describes an interactive technique for learning labeled transition systems from collections of message sequence charts. This technique is guided by an end-user, who is expected to classify additional scenarios as positive and negative system behaviors. In Section~\ref{section:inductive-mutliview-consistency}, fluent, goals and domain properties are injected in the process to enforce inter-model consistency and prune the inductive search space. Section \ref{section:inductive-from-hMSC} discusses how hMSCs can replace scenario collections as richer synthesis input. Section \ref{section:inductive-discussion} concludes this chapter with a discussion.
