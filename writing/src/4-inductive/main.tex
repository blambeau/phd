\chapter{Inductive synthesis of LTS models from MSC and hMSC models\label{chapter:inductive-synthesis}}

This chapter presents a technique to infer state machines, one Labeled Transition System (LTS) for each agent of the system, from scenarios given as Message Sequence Charts (MSC) or high-level MSC.
