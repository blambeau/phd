\chapter{Inductive Synthesis of State Machines from Scenarios\label{chapter:inductive-synthesis}}

This chapter presents an inductive approach for synthesizing state machines from scenarios. Section~\ref{section:inductive-objectives-and-approach} characterizes the problem, discusses a few requirements and provides an overview of our solution. Section~\ref{section:inductive-background} provides some required background on grammar induction, the inductive framework on which our techniques are rooted \cite{Gold:1978}. Section~\ref{section:lts-induction-from-mscs} describes an interactive technique for learning LTS models from collections of MSCs. This technique is interactive; the end-user is expected to classify additional scenarios generated by the technique as positive and negative examples of system behavior. In Section~\ref{section:inductive-mutliview-consistency}, fluent, goals and domain properties are injected in the process to enforce inter-model consistency and prune the inductive search space for better performance. Section \ref{section:inductive-from-hMSC} discusses how hMSCs can be used as richer input of the synthesis process.
