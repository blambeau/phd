\chapter{Inductive Synthesis of State Machines from Scenarios\label{chapter:inductive-synthesis}}

This chapter presents inductive techniques for synthesizing state machines from scenarios. Section~\ref{section:inductive-overview} states the problem statement, discusses a few requirements and provides an overview of our approach. Section~\ref{section:inductive-background} provides background on grammar induction \cite{Gold:1978}, the inductive framework on which techniques of the chapter rely. Section~\ref{section:lts-induction-from-mscs} then describes an interactive inductive technique for learning Labeled Transition Systems (LTS) from collections of Message Sequence Charts (MSC). This technique is guided by an end-user, which is expected to classify additional MSC scenarios as positive and negative system behaviors. In Section~\ref{section:inductive-mutliview-consistency}, fluent, goals and domain properties are injected in the process to enforce inter-model consistency and prune the inductive search space. Section \ref{section:inductive-from-hMSC} discusses how hMSCs can replace scenario collections as input of the inductive process. Section \ref{section:inductive-discussion} concludes this chapter with a discussion about possible enhancements.
