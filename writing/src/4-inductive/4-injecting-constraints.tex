\subsection{Pruning the induction space with state information\label{subsection:induction-pruning-with-state-info}}

The interactive QSM algorithm described in section~\ref{algo} always provides a DFA consistent with the available positive and negative scenarios. The Blue-Fringe strategy can also be applied to reduce the number of additional scenarios submitted to the end-user. This strategy relies on two equivalence classes partitioning the states of an augmented PTA. These classes correspond to the positive and negative accepting states respectively\footnote{All states in a LTS are (positively) accepting. Hence, all states of $PTA(S_+)$ are positive accepting states. Since a negative scenario is the concatenation of a positive prefix with a single additional symbol, the augmented $PTA(S_+, S_-)$ only contains states labeled either as positive accepting or negative accepting.}. All states belonging to the same class are not necessarily merged in the final solution but the \texttt{Compatible} function guarantees that only states belonging to the same class can be merged.

This approach can be extended to incorporate various sources of domain knowledge. This knowledge refines the equivalence partition and further constrains the compatible merging operations. From an algorithmic point of view, inclusion of domain knowledge is thus straightforward but the resulting approach both speeds up the search and guarantees that the proposed solution is consistent with the domain knowledge.

Let us stress that domain knowledge is \textsl{optional} here as the QSM algorithm can work without it. However, if available, domain knowledge helps to further reduce the number of queries submitted to the end-user. The next sections describe how to include \textsl{fluents}, \textsl{models of external system components}, \textsl{descriptive statements} and \textsl{goals} in the induction process.

\subsubsection*{Propagating fluents}

The notion of fluent has been introduced in~\cite{Giannakopoulou:2003}.

\begin{definition}[Fluent]
A \emph{fluent} 
is a proposition defined by a set $Init_{Fl}$ of initiating events, a set $Term_{Fl}$ of 
terminating events, with $Init_{Fl}\cap Term_{Fl} = \emptyset$, and an initial boolean value.
\end{definition}

\noindent
For example, the fluent \emph{DoorsClosed} describes states of the train doors as being either \\
\centerline{\texttt{closed} ($DoorsClosed = true$) or \texttt{open} ($DoorsClosed = false$),} \\
and describes which event is responsible for which state change:

\hspace*{-.5cm}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\emph{DoorsClosed} $=\langle\{$\texttt{close doors}$\},$ &$\{$\texttt{open doors, emergency open}$\}\rangle$\\
&initially $true$.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

The value of every fluent can be computed on each PTA state by symbolic execution, starting from the initial state associated with the initial value for each fluent. The PTA states are then decorated with the conjunction of such values. Two states in $PTA(S_+, S_-)$ belong to the same equivalence class if they have the same value for every fluent. The decoration of the merged states is simply inherited from the states being merged. Figure~\ref{Fig:fluents} shows the result of propagating the values of the fluent \emph{DoorsClosed} along the augmented PTA built from the scenarios described in Figure~\ref{Fig:init:scen}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Unfolding models of external components}

Quite often the components being modeled need to interact with other components in their environment - \textit{e.g.}, legacy components in a bigger existing system, foreign components in an open system, etc. In such cases the behavior of external components is generally known - typically, through some behavioral model \cite{Hall:2004}. Here we assume that external components are known by their LTS model. For example, Figure~\ref{Fig:AlarmSensor} shows the LTS for a legacy alarm sensor in our train system. When the alarm button is pressed by a passenger, this component propagates a corresponding signal to the train controller. 

The PTA states can also be decorated with state labels from this external LTS by unfolding the latter on the PTA. Such decoration is performed by jointly visiting the PTA and the external LTS. The latter synchronizes on shared events and stays in its current state on other events. Figure~\ref{Fig:AlarmSensor:Unfolding} shows the result of unfolding the alarm sensor LTS from Fig.~\ref{Fig:AlarmSensor} on the augmented PTA built from the scenarios described in Fig.~\ref{Fig:init:scen}. Each state in Fig.~\ref{Fig:AlarmSensor:Unfolding} is labeled with the number of the corresponding state in the alarm sensor LTS. Two states belong to the same equivalence class if they have the same external LTS state label.

\subsection{Pruning the induction space with goals and domain properties\label{subsection:induction-pruning-with-goals}}

Descriptive statements about the domain, called \textsl{domain properties}, or prescriptive statements of intent about the target system, called \textsl{goals}, can be expressed declaratively with fluents in \textsl{Linear Temporal Logic} (LTL)~\cite{Giannakopoulou:2003}. LTL assertions use standard operators for temporal referencing such as:

\begin{center}
$\square$ (always in the future), $\diamond$ (some time in the future),\\
$\rightarrow$ (implies in the current state), $\Rightarrow$ (always implies).\\
\end{center}

For example, in an extended version of our running example, the statement

\begin{center}
	$\square (HighSpeed \rightarrow Moving)$
\end{center}

expresses a physical law stating that all scenarios for which a train is running at high speed while not moving should be considered as negative. 

A goal requiring train doors to remain closed while the train is moving is formalized as 
\begin{center}
$ DoorsClosedWhileMoving = \square (Moving \rightarrow DoorsClosed)$
\end{center}

We restrict here our attention to statements that can be formalized as LTL safety properties. For such properties, a tester can be automatically generated \cite{Giannakopoulou:2003}. A tester for a property is a LTS extended with a negative accepting state such that every path leading to this state violates the property. The tester LTS for the goal $DoorsClosedWhileMoving$ is represented in Figure~\ref{Fig:Goals:Injection} (the black state is the negative accepting state). Any event sequence leading to the black state from the initial state corresponds to an undesired system behavior. In particular, the event sequence \texttt{start, open} corresponds to the initial negative scenario in our running example (see Fig.\ref{Fig:init:scen}). The tester of Figure~\ref{Fig:Goals:Injection} provides many more negative scenarios, actually an infinite number of negative scenarios due to the cyclic nature of such LTS. The property tester is used to constrain the induction process in the same way as an external component LTS. The PTA and the tester are traversed jointly in order to decorate each PTA state with the corresponding tester state. Two states belong in the same equivalence class if they have the same property tester state. This technique has the additional benefit of ensuring that the synthesized global LTS satisfies the considered goal or domain property.
