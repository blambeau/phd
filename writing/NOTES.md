* 2011.06.30 - Sections to refactor in chapter 4

  * Restate the requirement that all scenarios start in the same system state
    somewhere. This is left implicit because of scenario collections so far. 

  * Add a sentence about "membership queries" before using the term.

  * Normalize images and verify that abbreviates are correctly introduced.

      \texttt{a.pres}, \texttt{a.prop}, \texttt{e.open}, \texttt{e.stop} stand for \texttt{alarm pressed, alarm propagated, emergency open, emergency stop} respectively}.

  * Section 4.5 - LTS synthesis from high-level MSCs

    * State that the initial state assumption is no longer required here.

  * Add an illustration to union of hMSC languages in 4.5.1
