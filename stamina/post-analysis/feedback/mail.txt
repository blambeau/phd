Subject: Feedback about the Stamina competition 
Mail: +{mail}

Dear Stamina Participant,

As you certainly know the StaMinA competition (http://stamina.chefbe.net) is now over. We are currently in the process of analyzing and documenting competition data and results. A detailed review, together with a paper about the DFASAT winner algorithm, will be submitted to a special issue of the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10664).

In attachement you'll find the best score you've reached on each problem with your *+{algorithm}* algorithm. Attached plots allow you to compare your score with the Blue-Fringe baseline. We encourage you to complete your online submission grid (the oracle is still available), especially if your algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline. See README.txt for details.

In order to prepare the special issue, we also would like to collect feedback from participants. Can I kindly ask you to take a few minutes to help us in this task? We are especially interrested in collecting

* Summaries about used approaches, and/or references to related publications, ...
* Comments about your participation, the competition protocol, ...
* Whishes/ideas about a competition outcome, second phase?, ...
* Whishes/ideas about the oracle & online data: should we convert the oracle to an exact scoring one?, disclose the target machines and test samples?, give access to your complete submission data? ...
* Any other comment or idea

Thanks for your participation and feedback!
The Stamina Organizers
